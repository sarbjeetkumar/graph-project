This sky wars game is based on old sky ship game where you have to save your ship in the sky from another flying ships and you have to shot them to save and get the score .

####First i defined all my enemys in my css.

 /*Declaring the images*/
            /*Creating all the enemy's*/
            .enemy1{
                width: 38px;
                height: 55px;
                background-image: url(enemy1.png);
            }
            .enemy2{
                 width: 38px;
                height: 55px;
                background-image: url(enemy2.png);
            }
            .enemy3{
                 width: 58px;
                height: 50px;
                background-image: url(enemy3.png);
            }
            .enemy4{
                 width: 60px;
                height: 40px;
                background-image: url(enemy4.png);
